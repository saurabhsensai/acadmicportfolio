This blog contains a link to a Google Colab file that provides a PyTorch tutorial from scratch. Users can open the file in Colab and copy it to their own Google Drive by clicking 'File' > 'Save a copy in Drive'. To run the notebook, ensure that the runtime is set to GPU for faster execution by going to 'Runtime' > 'Change runtime type' and selecting 'GPU' under hardware accelerator.
