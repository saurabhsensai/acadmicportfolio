I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology degree with Honours from [Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, Islampur](https://www.ritindia.edu/ritwebsite/website/index.php) and a Computer Engineering diploma from [Cusrow Wadia Institute of Technology, Pune](https://cwit.mespune.org/). 

Currently, I am a Data Scientist at Core AI, where I focus on 3D MRI processing and classification, specifically working on Alzheimerâ€™s disease detection. My work involves developing advanced deep learning models to analyze brain MRI scans, contributing to early diagnosis and progression tracking of neurodegenerative disorders. Previously, I worked at RIT Islampur, where I applied vision transformers for kidney blood vessel segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance. I have also interned at Cognautica SF, improving OCR accuracy for AI grading systems, and at IITD-AIA Foundation, where I contributed to computer vision-based defect detection in 3D-printed parts. 

Beyond research and development, I have demonstrated leadership as the Vice President and AI/ML Lead of Google DSC at RIT Islampur and as the President of IUCEE EWB (Engineers Without Borders).

I am also passionate about teaching and enjoy sharing knowledge through YouTube videos and written tutorials on various topics. By creating educational content, I aim to make complex AI and machine learning concepts more accessible to a wider audience.
